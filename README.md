# A Vaila Ball
A game called A Vaila Ball.

Optimization (Queue Data Structure)
----------------
- There will always be 9 objects in total in the game.
- These objects are enqueued to the queue once the game is started.
- As soon as the player passes the 6th object,
- the code automatically dequeues the first 3 objects from the queue (6 left),
- and enqueues 3 new objects to the queue (9 objects again).
- This provides a more efficient game because the game will always consist of 9 objects in total.
